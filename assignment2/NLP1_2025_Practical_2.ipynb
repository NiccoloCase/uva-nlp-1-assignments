    "In this second practical, we will train neural network models to obtain sentence representations. We can then use these sentence representations for a downstream task such as sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will help you to develop models for your experiments. But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case. **Make sure you run all your code before submitting the notebook, and do not leave unnecessary print statements / cells in your notebook that are not intended for the grader.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important!** The main purpose of this lab is for you to learn how to answer research questions by experimenting and then writing a scientific report.\n",

    "### Data set\n",
    "We will use the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) (SST), which provides sentences, their binary tree structure, and fine-grained sentiment scores.\n",
    "This dataset is different from the one we used in the first practical.\n",
    "In Practical 1, a review consisted of several sentences, and we had one sentiment score for the whole review. Now, a review consists of a single sentence, and we have a sentiment score for each node in the binary tree that makes up the sentence, including the root node (i.e., we still have an overall sentiment score for the entire review). We will look at an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this practical we will only make use of the sentence tokens whereas in the second part we will also exploit the tree structure that is provided by the SST.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bag-of-words (BOW)\n",
    "- Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)\n",
    "- Deep continuous bag-of-words (Deep CBOW)\n",

    "The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a rather small data set, since it required fine-grained manual annotatation. This makes it difficult for the Deep CBOW model to learn good word embeddings, i.e. to learn good word representations for the words in our vocabulary.\n",

The \"original\" Stanford Sentiment classification [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1150.pdf) used Glove embeddings, which are just another method (like *word2vec*) to get word embeddings from unannotated text. Glove is described in the following paper which you should cite if you use them:\n",

    "\n",
    "Using these pre-trained word embeddings, we can initialize our word embedding lookup table and start form a point where similar words are already close to one another in the distributional semantic space.\n",

    "You can choose to keep the word embeddings **fixed** or to train them further, specialising them to the task at hand.\n",
    "We will keep them fixed for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this lab, it is enough if you understand how word2vec works (whichever vectors you use), but if you are interested, we encourage you to also check out the GloVe paper.\n",

    "\n",
    "[**OPTIONAL in case you don't want to mount Google Drive:** instead of running all the 5 boxes below, you can 1) download the GloVe and word2vec in your local machine, 2) upload them on your Drive folder (\"My Drive\"). Then, uncomment the first 2 lines in box 6 before writing your code!]\n"

    "Data sparsity and a small data set can cause *overfitting*. This is a phenomenom that is very likely to occur when training strong and expressive models, like LSTMs, on small data. In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

    "The code below contains the TreeLSTM class, which implements everything we need in order to encode a sentence from word embeddings. The calculations are the same as in the paper, implemented such that the class `TreeLSTMCell` above is as general as possible and only takes two children to reduce them into a parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialize $\\mathbf{h}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ outside of the cell for the leaves**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the leaves of each tree the children nodes are **empty**, whereas in higher levels the nodes are binary tree nodes that *do* have a left and right child (but no input $x$). By initializing the leaf nodes outside of the cell class (`TreeLSTMCell`), we avoid if-else statements in the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TreeLSTM` class (among other things) pre-calculates an initial $h$ and $c$ for every word in the sentence. Since the initial left and right child are 0, the only calculations we need to do are based on $x$, and we can drop the forget gate calculation (`prev_c_l` and `prev_c_r` are zero). The calculations we do in order to initalize $h$ and $c$ are then:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Sentence Representations**\n",

Each sentence is represented by a buffer (initially a list with a concatenation of $[h_1, c_1]$ for every word in the reversed sentence), a stack (initially an empty list) and a transition sequence. To encode our sentence, we construct the tree from its transition sequence as explained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A short example that constructs a tree:*\n",
    "\n",
    "We loop over the time dimension of the batched transition sequences (i.e. row by row), which contain values of 0's, 1's and 2's (representing SHIFT, REDUCE and padding respectively). If we have a batch of size 2 where the first example has a transition sequence given by [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] and the second by [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], our transition batch will be given by the following two-dimensional numpy array:\n",

    "- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed.\n",
    "More precisely, you should run each model with 3 different seeds, and for each of these 3 runs, evaluate the best model (according to the validation) on the test dataset. The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",

    "Your report needs to be written in LaTeX. You are required to use the ACL template which you can download from or edit directly on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Make sure your names and student numbers are visible at the top. (Tip: you need to change `review` to `final` in `\\usepackage[review]{acl}`).\n",
    "You can find some general tips about writing a research paper [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/), but note that you need to make your own judgment about what is appropriate for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to use the following structure:\n",
    "1. Introduction (~1 page) - describe the problem, your research questions and goals, a summary of your findings and contributions. Please cite related work (models, data set) as part of your introduction here, since this is a short paper.\n",
    "    - Introduce the task and the main goal\n",
    "    - Present your research questions\n",
    "    - Motivate the importance of the questions\n",
    "    - Present and explain your expectations\n",
    "    - Make clear whether the research questions are addressed or not addressed in the literature\n",
    "    - Describe the approach you use to answer the research questions\n",
    "    - Summarise your findings\n",
    "2. Background (~1/2-1 page) -\n",
    "cover the main techniques (\"building blocks\") used in your project (e.g. word embeddings, LSTM, Tree-LSTM) and intuitions behind them. Be accurate and concise.\n",
    "    - How does each technique work? (Don't just copy the formulas)\n",
    "    - What is the relation between the techniques?\n",
    "3. Models (~1/2 page) - Describe the architecture of the final models.\n",
    "    - How do you use LSTM or Tree-LSTM for the sentiment classification task?\n",
    "    - What layers do you have, how do you do classification?\n",
    "    - What is your loss function?\n",
    "    - Etc.\n",
    "4. Experiments (~1/2 page) - Describe your experimental setup. This section should allow someone else to reproduce your experiments. Describe how you evaluate the models.\n",
    "    - Task and the data\n",
    "    - Training (model, data, parameters and hyper parameters, training algorithms, supervision signals, etc.)\n",
    "    - Evaluation (e.g. metrics)\n",
    "5. Results and Analysis (~1 page). Present the results and analyse your findings.\n",
    "    - Answer each of the research questions you raised in the introduction.\n",
    "    - Use figures and tables to highlight interesting patterns\n",
    "    - What are the factors that make model A better than model B in task C? Investigate to prove their effect!\n",
    "6. Conclusion (~1/4 page). Present the conclusions that can be drawn from your experiments.\n",
    "    - What have you learned from you experiments?\n",
    "    - How do your findings relate to what is already known in the literature?\n",
    "    - Were the results as expected? Any surprising results? Why?\n",
    "    - Based on what you learned, what would you suggest doing next?\n",

    "At the end of your report (outside of the page limit), **you are expected to include a section titled 'Use of AI tools'**. By submitting the report you and your team member(s) testify that you did not use AI (LM-based tools and assistants (e.g. ChatGPT, UvA AI Chat, Gemini, etc.)) to draft an earlier version of your work, complete your code, suggest algorithms, revise your work or make suggestions that you implemented. If you did make use of an AI tool, you should describe the uses you made of it in the 'Use of AI tools' section, or indicate that no such tool was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math notation – define each variable (either in running text, or in a pseudo-legenda after or before the equation).\n",
    "- Define technical terminology you need.\n",
    "- Avoid colloquial language – everything can be said in a scientific-sounding way.\n",
    "- Avoid lengthy sentences, stay to the point.\n",
    "- Do not spend space on \"obvious\" things.\n",
    "- Do not go over the page limit. (We will deduct points for that.)\n",
    "- The page limit is 4 pages excluding references and appendix. This is a strict limit; points will be deducted for longer reports.\n",
    "- There is no strict limit to references and appendix. However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal report:\n",
    "- Precise, scientific, technical, to the point\n",
    "  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat\n",
    "- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much\n",
    "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
    "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
    "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
    "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
    "- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)\n"
